This project involves creating a Sun Tracking System using an Arduino Uno. The system tracks the position of the sun and adjusts the position of a solar panel to maximize the amount of sunlight received throughout the day. This README provides an overview of the project, including setup instructions, required components, and code usage.

Components Required
Arduino Uno
Servo Motors (2)
Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) (4)
Resistors (appropriate values for LDRs)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Solar panel (for demonstration purposes)
Power supply (if needed)
Circuit Diagram
[Include a clear and detailed circuit diagram here, showing the connections between the Arduino, LDRs, servos, and other components.]

Setup Instructions
Assemble the Circuit:

Connect the four LDRs to the analog pins of the Arduino (A0, A1, A2, A3).
Connect the servos to the PWM pins (e.g., D9 and D10) of the Arduino.
Use resistors to form voltage dividers with the LDRs, connecting them between the analog pins and ground.
Ensure all ground connections are common.
Upload the Code:

Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer using a USB cable.
Open the Arduino IDE and load the provided code (sun_tracking_system.ino).
Verify and upload the code to the Arduino.
Test the System:

Place the assembled system in an area where it can receive sunlight or use a flashlight to simulate sunlight.
Observe the movement of the servos as the system adjusts the position of the solar panel.
Troubleshooting
Servo not moving: Ensure the servo is properly connected to the correct PWM pin and powered adequately.
Incorrect LDR readings: Check the connections and ensure the LDRs are correctly positioned.
Code upload issues: Verify that the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE.
